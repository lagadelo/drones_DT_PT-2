Perimeter surveillance of critical infrastructure~\cite{CISA_PhysSec_Intro} demands autonomous drone architectures that maintain coverage under adversarial asset loss while preserving operational security. We present a hybrid Physical Twin / Digital Twin (PT/DT) coordination framework for circulating drone networks operating under strict furtivity constraints. PT drones execute identical distributed density-balancing algorithms using only local neighbor perception—with no inter-drone messaging—to achieve emergent coverage through adaptive spacing and velocity modulation. The DT maintains suppletive fleet state estimation via dead-reckoning and exception-only telemetry (loss events, intrusion detections), runs event-driven predictive simulations using the same PT control law, and conditionally stages spares at gap midpoints when forecasted density variance or coverage violate mission thresholds.

Critically, DT interventions remain silent: spare drones self-insert into the patrol circuit as physical actions rather than explicit commands; PT drones perceive newcomers as neighbors and absorb them through local balancing, unaware of centralized coordination. This architectural decomposition delivers layered resilience—rapid distributed self-adaptation for minor disruptions, threshold-based spare staging for severe losses—while satisfying autonomy-first principles (no teleoperation, local decision-making authority), furtivity (exception-only RF signatures), and communication efficiency (sparse telemetry, no continuous supervisory messaging)~\cite{Li2020_EventTriggeredSurvey}.
